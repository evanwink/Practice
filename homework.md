# Ethan: Here's some stuff to do!

Take a look at [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/interview-practice/) to practice the basic data structures of python3. Arrays ("lists"), Hash tables ("dictionaries"), trees, heaps, stacks, queues!

Once you get a feel for the different data structures, try out the Python Arcade. It is a nice tour of the different modules of python's standard library. Some of the problems are a little weird, so just skip them. I recorded my solutions to many of these problems [here](https://github.com/chuckinator0/Projects/tree/master/scripts).

Start with that and I'll do another pull request when you want to go further.
